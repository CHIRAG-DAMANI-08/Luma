# Mood Tracking Page - Implementation Documentation

## Overview of Changes
We've made several improvements to the mood tracking page to enhance its appearance, usability, and responsiveness:

1. **Fixed Container Issues**: Removed the blue/green outer border by using fixed positioning and z-index
2. **Centered Content**: Aligned all elements centrally for better visual balance
3. **Color Scheme Adjustments**: Changed card backgrounds to white for a cleaner look
4. **Spacing Improvements**: Adjusted margins and paddings for better visual hierarchy
5. **Added Navigation**: Implemented a back-to-dashboard button and user profile icon
6. **Responsive Design**: Ensured the page works well on various screen sizes
7. **Improved Form Elements**: Enhanced textarea and buttons for better user experience
